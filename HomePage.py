                            Welcome to our book recommendation system!
                            In our website, there are three models available. Let us provide you a bit of insight into them.
                            1. Simple Recommender:
                            This model offers generalized recommendations to every user based on popularity and average rating of 
                            the book. This model does not provide user-specific recommendations.
                            
                            2.  Content Based Filtering:
                            To personalise our recommendations, you need to pick your favorite book. The model will suggest books that 
                            are most similar to a particular book that a user liked.
                            
                            3. Content and Review Based Filtering:
                            The mechanism to remove books with low ratings has been added on top of the content based filtering.
                            This model will return books that are similar to your input, are popular and have high ratings.
